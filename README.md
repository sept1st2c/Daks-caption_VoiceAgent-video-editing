# Expressive Captions

Captions that hear how you said it.

Most auto-captions treat a reel as a stream of equally important words. You shout one word, drag
out another, drop your voice on the next, and the captions come out flat anyway. Expressive
Captions listens for that. It transcribes Hinglish, works out which words were stressed, stretched
or angry, and draws them that way. Then you fix whatever you don't like by talking to it.

Built for the AWS First Commit hackathon, Ship It track.

## Try it live

**[Open the demo project](https://4ofryng45bbr7en765off7otja0yuamo.lambda-url.ap-south-1.on.aws/editor?id=6f2ea8bfd891)**
is a 23-second reel that is already captioned. Nothing to install, nothing to upload, no login.

Once it is open, a few things worth doing:

1. Press play and watch the captions. The shouted and stretched words are drawn differently on purpose.
2. Click a word in the transcript on the left and change its style. Ctrl+Z undoes it.
3. Type in the bar at the bottom, *"make the captions bigger"*, or click the mic and say it.
4. Drag across empty space on the **Preset** row of the timeline to mark a stretch of the video, then pick
   a look in the **Presets** tab. It changes only that stretch.
5. Press **Export**. It takes about three minutes, then you can download the MP4 with the captions burned in.

Want to use your own video? [Start a new project](https://4ofryng45bbr7en765off7otja0yuamo.lambda-url.ap-south-1.on.aws/editor)
and drop in a reel of up to 90 seconds and 200 MB. A short reel is captioned in under a minute.

Use Chrome or Edge; the microphone needs HTTPS, which these addresses have. The same editor is also
on a [second address](https://master.dnb761en5gcll.amplifyapp.com), and the
[API health check](https://pra22j2hgp.ap-south-1.awsapprunner.com/health) should say `{"ok":true}`.
Everything runs in `ap-south-1` (Mumbai).

One caveat: there is no login yet, so please be kind to it.

## What it does

**Captions with delivery in them.** Upload a reel of up to 90 seconds. The pipeline transcribes the
Hindi with word timings, turns each word into Roman Hinglish, and measures loudness, pitch and
duration per word. A clip of about 23 seconds is ready in roughly 40. Words come out tagged as
emphasised, stretched, neutral, excited or angry, and the caption style follows: bigger, longer,
shaking. Seven presets set the base look (`rangmanch`, `chamak`, `nazm`, `dhamaka`, `mrbeast`,
`minimal`, `hinglish-bold`), and any stretch of the video can use a different one.

**Editing by talking.** Type in the bar, or click the mic and say *"make that line angry"*, *"the
word bahut in blue"*, *"minimal preset from two to four seconds"*. The agent can also look at the
video, so *"put the captions where my hand is"* and stickers that sit on a face both work. Every
agent turn is one undo. And when typing is quicker than explaining, you can fix a word's text or
its timing by hand in the inspector.

**Your own media on top.** Two tracks of images and clips over the video: move, scale, rotate,
trim, split, delete. The main video is never cut or re-timed. That is a deliberate line, not a
missing feature.

**Export that matches the preview.** The MP4 is drawn by Remotion using the same caption code the
editor previews with, so what you see is what you download. A 23-second clip takes about three
minutes.

## How it fits together

One idea holds the project up: **everything reads and writes a single `Project` JSON**. Words with
their timings and tone, the preset, the layers. The editor edits it, the pipeline produces it, the
renderer draws it.

That has two consequences worth knowing. The agent never edits pixels. It returns small patches to
the JSON, every one validated against the schema before it is applied, and the transcript reaches
the model as data in tags, never as instructions. And preview equals export, because both are
just this JSON run through the same React code.

![System diagram](docs/images/architecture-system.png)

The browser talks to two public things, the editor files and the API. Big uploads and downloads go
straight to S3 on signed links. The renderer and the voice worker sit in a private network and only
ever call out. [`docs/architecture.md`](docs/architecture.md) has the three flows drawn step by step
(upload, voice edit, export).

## Run it on your machine

You need Docker, Node 24 (`nvm use` reads `.nvmrc`), and AWS credentials in `~/.aws`. You do not
need a LiveKit account: compose runs a local dev server.

```bash
cp .env.example .env            # set DEV_PREFIX to your slot: p1, p2, p3 or p4
docker compose up -d --build    # API, LiveKit, voice worker
curl localhost:8010/health      # {"ok":true}

nvm use && npm install
cd apps/web && npm run dev
```

Open <http://localhost:5173/editor?demo=1> for a 28-second demo project with 51 captioned words, so
you can poke at the editor without uploading anything. Two things it needs: `VITE_USE_FIXTURE=true`
in `.env` (the example file sets it), and the demo clip itself. The clip is not in the repo. Drop a
file named `Normal.mp4` into `services/api/scripts/stt_bakeoff/clips/` (git-ignored; ask a
teammate for it), or the captions load over a blank player. Without the clip, upload your own reel
at `/editor` instead.

Export is opt-in, because its image carries a headless Chrome and takes a few minutes to build the
first time: `docker compose --profile export up -d --build`.

[`docs/getting-started.md`](docs/getting-started.md) covers the AWS access each part needs, the
full check list, and a table of what to look at when something breaks.

## Where things live

| Path | What is in it |
| --- | --- |
| `apps/web` | The editor: React, TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind, shadcn/ui |
| `services/api` | FastAPI backend: the pipeline, storage, the render route |
| `services/api/app/agent` | The agent: Bedrock tool loop and the tools it can call |
| `services/voice-agent` | LiveKit worker that turns speech into text |
| `remotion` | Caption composition, presets, and the render server for export |
| `packages/shared` | The `Project` schema (`project.ts`) and sample projects |
| `infra/aws` | Terraform for the AWS stack |
| `.claude` | The engineering log: one audit per phase, and an index of them |

`services/api/app/schema.py` mirrors `packages/shared/src/project.ts`. They change together or not
at all.

## Checks

```bash
docker compose exec api python -m pytest tests/ -q -p no:warnings        # API
cd apps/web && npx tsc -b && npm run check:agent && npm run check:captions && npm run check:layers
```

The agent has its own test scripts under `services/api/app/agent/tests/`. The full list, and the
one that speaks a real phrase into a real LiveKit room, is in
[getting started](docs/getting-started.md#2-check-it-actually-works).

## Rough edges

We would rather you hear these from us.

- The API has no authentication. Anyone who can reach it can use it.
- Export renders one video at a time. The caption pipeline runs inside the API process, so a
  restart during a job loses that job.
- Voice needs a speech-to-text provider your AWS identity may use. If Transcribe streaming is
  denied, set `VOICE_STT_PROVIDER=sarvam` and `SARVAM_API_KEY`; the story is in
  [`.claude/audits/ai-agent/phase-17-e2e-voice-and-editor.md`](.claude/audits/ai-agent/phase-17-e2e-voice-and-editor.md).
- Voice has been tested with synthesised speech and typed commands, not much with real mics and
  real accents.
- Bedrock and Transcribe run on borrowed credentials on the deployed stack until the owning
  account is unblocked.

The longer list, with what is verified and what is only mocked, is in
[Deployment](docs/deployment.md#11-honest-limitations).
